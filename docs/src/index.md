> Magic is distilled laziness

This theme, named after the fantasy setting of [Dungeons & Dragons](https://www.dndbeyond.com/), is designed with tabletop RPG players in mind. The theme allows beautiful HTML exports designed to look like a professionally made tabletop resource, whilst remaining easy to edit in code view and in small windows, thanks to CSS media queries.

Torillic v2 is the second incarnation of the Torillic theme, you can download older versions [here](https://github.com/TEParsons/torillic/releases).

### Installation
Torillic started as a Typora theme, but has since crossed over into several platforms, as well as having a base stylesheet which you can use in any HTML-based project. Whatever platform you're using Torillic on, you can find the latest version [here](https://github.com/TEParsons/torillic/releases), along with installation instructions.

### Contributing
Torillic is all open source, you can access it [here](https://github.com/TEParsons/torillic) on GitHub. I'm very open to contributions, especially if you'd like to add implementations for your preferred platform! I'm interested to see what other people use for their TTRPG resources (personally I tend to use Obsidian and mkdocs if I'm hosting it on the web, or Typora for printed resources).

### Tips & Tricks

- Using `> blockquotes` will create a green box like the ones used in 5e stat blocks
- In full page view, content is arranged into two columns - however, `# heading 1` and `# heading 2` elements span both columns so can be used as separators. A blank top-level heading will still split the page.
- The heading with a yellow line underneath (you know the one) is `#### heading 4`
- Actions in 5e stat blocks are generally formatted like so:
```markdown
***Name.*** *Attack Type:* +[modifier] to hit, reach [reach] ft., [n targets] target(s). *Hit:* [approx damage] ([n dice]d[die size] + [additional]) [damage type] damage.
```
- For an example of a full stat sheet in Torillic, check out the markdown below the screenshots.
- Ultimately, it's yours to play with, so feel free to completely ignore this advice and lay things out however works for your capaign!
