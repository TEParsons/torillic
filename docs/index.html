<p>This theme, named after the fantasy setting of <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>, is designed with tabletop RPG players in mind. The theme allows beautiful HTML exports designed to look like a professionally made tabletop resource, whilst remaining easy to edit in code view and in small windows, thanks to CSS media queries.</p>
<p>Torillic v2 is the second incarnation of the Torillic theme, you can download older versions <a href="https://github.com/TEParsons/torillic/releases">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>Torillic started as a Typora theme, but has since crossed over into several platforms, as well as having a base stylesheet which you can use in any HTML-based project. Whatever platform you're using Torillic on, you can find the latest version <a href="https://github.com/TEParsons/torillic/releases">here</a>, along with installation instructions.</p>
<h3 id="contributing">Contributing</h3>
<p>Torillic is all open source, you can access it <a href="https://github.com/TEParsons/torillic">here</a> on GitHub. I'm very open to contributions, especially if you'd like to add implementations for your preferred platform! I'm interested to see what other people use for their TTRPG resources (personally I tend to use Obsidian and mkdocs if I'm hosting it on the web, or Typora for printed resources).</p>
<h3 id="tips-tricks">Tips &amp; Tricks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Using <code>&gt; blockquotes</code> will create a green box like the ones used in 5e stat blocks</li>
<li>In full page view, content is arranged into two columns - however, <code># heading 1</code> and <code># heading 2</code> elements span both columns so can be used as separators. A blank top-level heading will still split the page.</li>
<li>The heading with a yellow line underneath (you know the one) is <code>#### heading 4</code></li>
<li>Actions in 5e stat blocks are generally formatted like so:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">***Name.*** *Attack Type:* +[modifier] to hit, reach [reach] ft., [n targets] target(s). *Hit:* [approx damage] ([n dice]d[die size] + [additional]) [damage type] damage.
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>For an example of a full stat sheet in Torillic, check out the markdown below the screenshots.</li>
<li>Ultimately, it's yours to play with, so feel free to completely ignore this advice and lay things out however works for your capaign!</li>
