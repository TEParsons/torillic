# Torillic
> Magic is distilled laziness

This theme, named after the fantasy setting of [Dungeons & Dragons](https://www.dndbeyond.com/), is designed with tabletop RPG players in mind. The theme allows beautiful HTML exports designed to look like a professionally made tabletop resource, whilst remaining easy to edit in code view and in small windows, thanks to CSS media queries.

## Installation
Torillic started as a theme for the markdown editor Typora, but has since crossed over into several different platforms. This repository contains the core stylesheet for Torillic, which is used across platforms. To install on a given platform, check out the sub-project repo for that project:
- **Typora**: [typora-torillic](https://github.com/TEParsons/typora-torillic)
- **MkDocs**: [mkdocs-torillic](https://github.com/TEParsons/mkdocs-torillic)
- **Sphinx**: [sphinx-torillic](https://github.com/TEParsons/sphinx-torillic)

## Contributing
Torillic is all open source, you can access it here on GitHub. I'm very open to contributions, especially if you'd like to add implementations for your preferred platform! To use the base theme, I recommend adding a text file called `torillic.stub` in the location where you want the base torillic theme to be and then using a script (such as `utils/stub.py` here) to copy the folder from this repo in your build process. If you implement Torillic in a new platform, please do feel free to put in a pull request to this repo including it in the list above!

I'm also interested to see what other people use for their TTRPG resources (personally I tend to use Obsidian and mkdocs if I'm hosting it on the web, or Typora for printed resources).

## Tips & Tricks

- Using `> blockquotes` will create a green box like the ones used in 5e stat blocks
- In full page view, content is arranged into two columns - however, `# heading 1` and `# heading 2` elements span both columns so can be used as separators. A blank top-level heading will still split the page.
- The heading with a yellow line underneath (you know the one) is `#### heading 4`
- Actions in 5e stat blocks are generally formatted like so:
```markdown
***Name.*** *Attack Type:* +[modifier] to hit, reach [reach] ft., [n targets] target(s). *Hit:* [approx damage] ([n dice]d[die size] + [additional]) [damage type] damage.
```
- For an example of a full stat sheet in Torillic, check out the markdown below the screenshots.
- Ultimately, it's yours to play with, so feel free to completely ignore this advice and lay things out however works for your campaign!

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

#### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (2d10 + 7) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) lightning damage.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened) for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Lightning Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** The dragon exhales lightning in a 90-­foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Legendary Actions

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Detect.*** The dragon makes a Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) check.

***Tail Attack.*** The dragon makes a tail attack.

***Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).*** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (2d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone). The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
